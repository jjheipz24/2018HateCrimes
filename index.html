                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p id="into">The United States is commonly referred to as a "melting pot" because it is rich
                            with cultures from around the world.
                            The ideal would be for everyone to coexist peacefully, but unfortunately many people are
                            scared of difference.
                            There are people in America who are fueled with hate, especially towards those that appear
                            different from them, and choose to act on that hate in violent ways. The data presented here
                            comes directly from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's official database and looks at
                            reported hate crimes throughout the U.S. Due to the large amount of data, I chose to
                            specifically use the most recent collection which comes from 2018.
                            <br><br><b>**DISCLAIMER**</b><br><br>
                            This data comes solely from the information provided and is not a reflection of my own
                            beliefs and values. Although many people see hate crimes as only being crimes against
                            minority groups, the FBI does not view them as being exclusive to minorities. They define a
                            hate crime as a "criminal offense against a person or
                            property motivated in whole or in part by an offenderâ€™s bias against a race, religion,
                            disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity."<sub><a

            <section id="story">
                <h2>What is Being Investigated?</h2>
                <p>There are five main categories of hate crimes that this data looks at in each state: <b>Race,
                        Religion, Disability,
                        Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation.</b> Each category can be broken down into sub-groups to
                    further look at which specific group was targeted in a hate-motivated crime. For example, within the
                    "Disability" category, it gets broken down into whether the crime was committed against someone for
                    a physical disability or a mental one.</p>

                <h2>How to View the Data</h2>
                <p>Use the dropdown to select the state you would like to look at. The bar graph lists the total number
                    of hate crimes reported each month in 2018. Clicking on a bar will allow you to look at a breakdown
                    of what kind of hate crimes occurred in that month. The sunburst will show you the main category,
                    the sub-group, where it was committed, and the date it was committed.</p>

                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>Generally speaking, the type of hate crime that seems to be the most prevalent among all 50 (actually
                    49 because Wyoming isn't listed) is race-related, specifically against Black/African-American
                    people. Race-related hate crimes are frequently seen as making up <b>at least 50%</b> of the hate
                    crimes reported. In many instances across the states listed, Anti-Black hate crimes contribute to
                    <i>all</i>, or nearly all, race-related hate crimes in a given month.</i></b> The second largest
                    reported hate crime is unsurprisingly sexual orientation-related crimes. Within this category, the
                    majority of crimes are against gay males. The other types within that category are against gay
                    women, bisexual people, and any other queer orientation. The third category that stands out as being
                    reported often is religion. Religious hate crimes are mostly against Jewish people and Muslims*.
                    <br><br><small>*I acknowledge the fact that some argue that being Muslim or Jewish is more than just
                        a
                        religion. For simplicity's sake of the data visualization, I have chosen to group them under
                        "Religion."</small></p>

                <h2>Caveats</h2>
                <p>It is very difficult to compare each state to one another because this data does not take into
                    account differences in population size. For example, it makes sense that California has drastically
                    more cases than Delaware or Rhode Island, solely for the fact that it is vastly more densely
                    populated. Another important point to note is that these are just reports. There is no information
                    detailing whether or not these cases were proven to be true or false. In the data itself, it lists
                    offense descriptions, and some list car theft as a hate crime, which seems highly improbable.
                    Lastly, as noted under the dropdown menu, many states are not required to collect any data relating
                    to hate crimes--some don't even have hate crime laws. This means that there are most likely more
                    hate crimes in these states that just go unnoticed (not to mention, Wyoming is absent from the data
                    completely). Based on the findings of what is provided, it can be safe to assume that the data
                    unreported would align with the patterns seen here.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>From this data, it is evident that the United States needs to do more work to protect people from
                    bias-fueled hate crimes. Black people, gay people, and Jewish and Islamic people are still subjected
                    to prejudice and hate in 2018 (and even today in 2020). This hate has roots deep in U.S. history,
                    dating even before slavery. It needs to end, but it can't without action from everyone.
                    There are a surprising number of states that do not have hate crime laws and/or do not have to
                    report hate crimes, which means the American people and the government are not being accurately
                    informed of the prevalence of this issue. We, as a country, need to make changes to bring these
                    numbers down. </p>
